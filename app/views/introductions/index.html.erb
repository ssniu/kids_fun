  <h2>Reading</h2>
  <p>
    Reading (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)">Wiki</a>)
    is a means of language acquisition, communication,
    and of sharing information and ideas. Like all languages,
    it is a complex interaction between the text and the reader
    which is shaped by the readerâ€™s prior knowledge, experiences,
    attitude, and language community which is culturally and socially
    situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development,
    and refinement. In addition, reading requires creativity and critical analysis.

  <h2>Math</h2>
  <p>
    Mathmatics (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">Wiki</a>)
    is essential in many fields, including natural science,
    engineering, medicine, finance and the social sciences.
    Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical
    disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians
    also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake,
    without having any application in mind. There is no clear line separating
    pure and applied mathematics, and
    practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.

  <h2>Art</h2>
  <p>
    Art (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">Wiki</a>)
    is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, 
    auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the
    author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated
    for their beauty or emotional power.[1][2] In their most general form
    these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism
    of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.
